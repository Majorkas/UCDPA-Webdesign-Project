# UCDPA-Webdesign-Project
In this project I will be showing everything I have learned so far in the first module Web Design 

My goal for this website is to design a working website for a band I like with multiple pages and a good css styling to make it look like a modern website.

My plan is to have 4 pages on my website the first being the home page aka index, the second a page where you can see where the band will be touring, the third a page dedicated to different merch you could get fro the band and lastly a Subscription page with a few form to sign up for a newsletter and links to all the socials.

A few sources I will be using is the bands actual website for the tours and news section
(https://toolband.com)
I will also have a youtube video from

Some background images I got from 
(https://wallpaperflare.com)
Social media icons found at

Designed for mobile at a minimum screen size of 377px and a max of 599px then changing to a new styling in some sections
