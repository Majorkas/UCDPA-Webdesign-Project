                    ***Planning Analysis Sheet***

In this project I will be showing everything I have learned so far in the first module Web Design

My goal for this website is to design a working website for a band I like with multiple pages and a good css styling to make it look like a modern website.

My plan is to have 4 pages on my website the first being the home page aka index, the second a page where you can see where the band will be touring, the third a page dedicated to different merch you could get from the band and lastly a Subscription page with a form to sign up for a newsletter and links to all the socials.

A few sources I will be using is the bands actual website for the tours and merch section :
(https://toolband.com)
Some background images I got from :
(https://wallpaperflare.com)
Social media icons found at :
(https://www.iconfinder.com/)

Designed for mobile at a minimum screen size of 350px and a max of 599px then changing to a new styling in some sections for larger screens up to a max width of 2560px.

The colours used for the text and background I used a hex colour picker to grab the hex value on the colours of the home background image to use across the site.
