# UCDPA-Webdesign-Project
In this project I will be showing everything I have learned so far in the first module Web Design 

My goal for this website is to design a working website for a band I like with multiple pages and a good css styling to make it look like a modern website.

My plan is to have 4 pages on my website the first being the home page aka index, the second a page where you can see where the band will be touring, the third a page dedicated to different merch you could get fro the band and lastly a news page with a few short things happening with the band and a contact form at the end. 

A few sources I will be using is the bands actual website for the tours and news section

I will also have a youtube video from

Some background images I got from
